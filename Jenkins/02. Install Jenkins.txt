1. We need to install a JDK and then install jenkins.

2. Start jenkins service >sudo systemctl start jenkins

3. Jenkins UI works on port 8080 by default
   Open that port >sudo ufu allow 8080

4. Jenkins initally sets a admin password when installed stored in a file
    sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
