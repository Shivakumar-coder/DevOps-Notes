Challenges Jenkins solves:
1. Slower Releases
2. Manual Builds
3. Non repeatable processes
4. No automations

Continuous Integration (CI) :
Takeing code repo and packageing it for next process (mostlly to deployment).
In this stage, unit tests will be done and all other kinds of test like integration tests, etc.
All kinds of security checks will be done.

Continuous Delivery (CD) :
There is manual intervention. Like click a button on Jenkins to get deployment started.
