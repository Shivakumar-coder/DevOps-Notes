All the jenkins server which has main controller and slave jenkins build agent 
should have the same java versions installed.

Built Agents are task executers, they will fullfil the task written in jenkins file.
Built Agent can we set up in any type of platform but, needs to have java installed with the same version as master node.

Recommended Practice: To set up master and agent in different machines.

Layers:
1. Jenkins Master Node : Used to install and config jenkins, build pipelines, create jobs, etc.
2. Jenkins Worker Node : Worker node can be linux server or docker, windows server or docker.
3. Agents : Will be configured inside master or worker nodes, used to execute tasks.
4. Executers : These are the once which will actually do the tasks and fullfil the tasks.
