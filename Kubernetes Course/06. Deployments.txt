Deployment: This is a K8s object that comes higher in the hierarchy.
            This provides us with the ability to upgrade the underlying instances 
            seamlessly using rolling updates, undo changes and resume changes as required.

The definition file is same as replicaset except the kind now is Deployment.

To run the deployment file
>kubectl create -f <deployment-file-name>.yml


To check deployments
>kubectl get deployments

The deployment will create replicasets.
The replicasets will create new pods.


To see all the commands at once
>kubectl get all
