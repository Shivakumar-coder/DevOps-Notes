Rollout: Whenyou 1st create a deployment, it triggers a rollout.
         A new rollout creates a new deployment revision.

Deployment Strategy:
1. Recreate: Take down all the instances of old version at once and bring up new versions at once.
             This will create application downtime untill new versions are ready to accept new workload.

2. Rolling Update: This will take out one instance at a time and update it and moves to next instance only after finishing
                   the last updateing instance has come live.

By default the K8 will go with rolling update strategy if we do not specify any value for strategy while deploying a new version.

We can make the changes to the deployment file and then run below cmmd.
>kubectl apply -f <deployment-file-name>


The other way to set image by the cmmd itself. By this way the definition file is also update.
>kubectl set image deployment/<deployment-name> \
                <container-name>=<image-version>


Cmmd to undo the changes.
>kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>

To edit the deployment file
>kubectl edit deployment <deployment-file-name>
