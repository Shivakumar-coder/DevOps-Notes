Each pod in the node has 1 IP address assigned to it.

K8s does not automatically set up any type of n/w-ing.
K8s expects us to set up n/w-ing to meet certain fundamental requirement.
Ex: cisco, vmware NSX, flannel, cilium

1. All the containers/pods in the K8s cluster must be able to communicate with one another without having to config NAT
2. All the nodes must be able to communicate with containers and vice-versa without NAT.
