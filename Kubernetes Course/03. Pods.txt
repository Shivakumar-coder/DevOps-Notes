Kubernetes does not deploy containers directly on worker nodes.
The containers are encapsulated into a K8s object known as Pods.
Each pod is a single instance of an application.
A pod is the smallest object that you can create in K8s.
At any given time a pod only consists of only one container of one kind.

Multi-Container PODs : A pod can have more than one container running if it's different instance
from that of any other container running in the pod like a container which processes the doc uploaded 
by the user in the same pod's other container.

create and run a container in K8s:
>kubectl run nginx --image nginx
    This will create and run a container inside a pod on a node.


>kubectl get pods
    This will list all the running pods


>kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
    This provides a lot more info on the pod.


>kubectl get pods -o wide
    This will extend the get pods cmmd to include pod info, IP, etc as a list.

>kubectl delete pod <pod_name>
    This will delete the pod

A  note about creating pods using kubectl run.

To create a pod from the command line, use the command:

Create an NGINX Pod

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx

As of version 1.18, kubectl run (without any arguments such as --generator ) will create a pod instead of a deployment.

To create a deployment using imperative command, use kubectl create:

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
