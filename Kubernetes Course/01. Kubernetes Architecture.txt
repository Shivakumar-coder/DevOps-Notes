A Cluster is a group of Nodes.

A Node containes n number of Pods.
A Node is virtual or physical machine on which Kubernetes tools are installed.

A Pod containes n number of Container.

A Master Node is were control plane is installed to controle slave Nodes.

When you install Kubernetes on a system. You are install the following components.
1. API server:
    The API will act as a frontend service for Kubernetes like supporting CLI, etc.

2. etcd service:
    This is a key-value store. The etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store used by Kubernetes to store all the 
    data used to manage the cluster. etcd will store all the info of all the nodes and master on all the nodes in the cluster 
    in a distributed manner. It is also responsible to implement logs with in the cluster

3. kubelet service:
    This is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. The agent is responsible for making sure that the containers are 
    running on the nodes as expected.

4. Container Runtime:
    This is the underlying software (like Docker, rkt, CRI-O) that is used to run containers.

5. Controler:
    This is  the brain behind orchestration. They're responsible for noticing and responding when nodes, containers or 
    endpoints close down. The controllers make decisions to bring up new containers in such cases.

6. Scheduler:
    This is responsible for distributing work among all the nodes evenly and looks for any new containes and bringing them 
    into work force.

kubectl is the CLI for Kubernetes.


kube-apiserver, etcd, controller, scheduler are the components which will be installed on master node.

kubelet, container runtime are the components which will be installed on worker node.

All these 6 core Kubernetes components will communicate with each other over a network called CNI network.
Container Network Interface.

There is one other component called service kube proxy.
