Two ways to run shell script.
1. bash <script_name>.sh
2. Create your own executable command.

Before setting a executable command u need to change the file permission so that the .sh file has x bit (executable bit)
Ex:
chmod +x <shell-script name>

To execute a script as a command. Add the script containing dir to the $PATH
Ex:
echo $PATH
>>/user/local/sbin............................

export PATH=$PATH:<dir_name containing shell script>
