Helm has a number of components it will be working with.

1. Helm CLI: used to perform Helm activities like installing a chart, upgrading, rollback, etc.

2. Helm Charts: - They are a collection of files, they contain all the instructions that Helm needs to know to be able
                  to create the collection of objects that you need in your K8s cluster.
                - By using charts and adding the objects according to the specific instructions in the charts, Helm in a 
                  way, installs applications into your cluster.
                - When a chart is applied to your cluster, a release is created.
                - A release is a single installation of an app using a Helm chart.
                - Within each release you can have multiple revision.
                - Each revision is like a snapshot of the app.
                - Every time a change is made to the app, a new revision is created.

3. Chart repositories: - Carts, like docker repositories, can be uploaded to online public chart repository.
                       - A single place were we can find these publicly availabe charts is ArtifactHub.io

4. Metadata: - When we do a changes to a chart, metadata will store what is been done with Helm like edit charts, do a 
               installation or updation, etc. These data of the data is called metadata.
             - This metadata is stored inside the K8s cluster as K8s secrets.
             - By this Helm will always know everthing about what it did through metadata.

When a chart is applied to your cluster, a release is done by Helm. This release will be having a name.
This is because, we can have multiple releases based on single chart.
This is use full when we want the changes done to be tested on pre-prod and other env, since only the release is different 
but not the chart.
Ex:
---
>helm install my-site bitnami/wordpress
>help install my-second-site bitnami/wordpress

These 2 release can be changed without changing the other release.
