There will be many objects in k8s template files that are identical and written many times which results in duplicity and 
repeating things can get complicated.
Now, we can remove the repeating lines and move to what is called a partial or named template.
Ex:
_helpers.tpl
-------
{{- define "labels" }}
    app.kubernetes.io/name: nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: nginx
{{- end }}

The "_" in the name tells helm not to consider this file as a usual template file. Because when we run the helm 
create command, helm reads all the files in the templates dir and converts those into k8s manifests.
In this case, helm will considers this as an only a helper file, and we don't want this file to end up as a k8s 
manifests file.

All the files created with "_" are created or converted into a k8s manifest file.

Now we can write all the identical lines once under a define statement and use a user defined names.
Now, these lines can now be imported or rather included anywhere we want usin a simple template statement as from 
the example below.
Ex:
service.yaml
----
{{- template "labels" }}

To use normal templates and expect the values to be taken only from values file.
Ex:
_helpers.tpl
-------
{{- define "labels" }}
    app.kubernetes.io/name: {{ .Release.Name }}
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: {{ .Release.Name }}
{{- end }}

service.yaml
------
labels:
    {{- template "labels" . }}


When the file is generated, the format will not be changed when the k8s manifest files are formed. The number of 
space or indentation will not be set accordingly to the template files.
To fix this problem, we can make use of the function "indent" by pipeing it. But template is not a function, it's an action.
So, pipeing won't work on it. The other object which does the same job as template is "include" function
Ex:
metadata:
    name: {{ .Release.Name }}-nginx
    labels:
        {{- template "labels" . }}
spec:
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            {{- include "labels" . | indent 2 }}
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
            {{- include "labels" . | indent 4 }}
