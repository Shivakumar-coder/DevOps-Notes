To package a helm chart, run the package command
>helm package <name-of-the-chart-dir>

This will name the archive file with the chare name and version. The file is compressed to .tgz format.
Now we can upload this chart file to the chart repo.
But before uploading it to chart repo, consider signing your chart to avoide malicious activities.

Signing makes it safer for download by cryptographically sign files and packages.
