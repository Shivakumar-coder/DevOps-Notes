Pipes:
    Ex: >echo "abcd"
        abcd

        >echo "abcd" | tr a-z A-Z
        ABCD

{{ upper .Value.image.repository }} ====> NGINX
This can also be written with the help of pipes
    Ex: {{ .Value.image.repository | upper}} ====> NGINX

    Advantage:
        Ex: {{ .Value.image.repository | upper | quote}} ====> "NGINX"
        Ex: {{ .Value.image.repository | upper | quote | shuffle }} ====> GN"XNI"

With pipes we can add other functions as well to the same object in series

Success is not final, failure is 
not fatal: it is the courage to 
continue that counts.
