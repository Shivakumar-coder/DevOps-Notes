There are 3 ways to verify that the chart is working as expected.

1. Linting will verify the chart and the YAML format is correct.
    Ex: >helm lint ./nginx-chart

2. 2ndly, verifying the template helps us make sure that the templating part is working as expected.
    Ex: >helm template ./nginx-chart
        >helm template ./nginx-chart --debug

3. 3rd option is the dry run option, which helps us make sure that the chart works well with k8s itself.
    Ex: >helm install hello-word-1 ./nginx-chart --dry-run
