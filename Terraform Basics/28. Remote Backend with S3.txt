We need 2 things to move state file to remote backend.

1. AWS S3 bucket to store terraform state file
2. DynamoDB table which will be used to implement state locking and consistency checks.

Write a terraform block which consists of aws pre-requists
---terraform.tf---
terraform {
    backend "s3" {
        bucket = "bucket-to-store-terraform-state-file" // AWS S3 unique bucket name.
        key = "finance/terraform.tfstate" // Name of the file to be stored in s3 bucket
        region = "us-west-1" //aws region
        dynamodb_table = "state-locking" // table name
    }
}
