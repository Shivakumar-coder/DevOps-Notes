To access aws programmaticaly we need to have Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
Both needs to be created by admin and given to you.
To support AWS programmatic access, we need to install AWS CLI.
After installing the AWS CLI we need to config AWS CLI with Access Key ID and Access Key.
>aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: <key_id>
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <key>
Default region name [None]: <region_closest_to_developer>
Default output format [None]: <json or yaml or xml ... etc>

The id and key are stored in a hidden dir .aws/config/config

AWS command syntax
>aws <command> <subcommand> [options and parameters]

you the most in the most

original manner possible.

Create user in aws cli:
>aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam create-user --user-name mary

What is the default region that has been configured for use with the AWS CLI ?
>cat /root/.aws/config

What is the aws_access_key_id used in the configuration ?
>cat /root/.aws/credentials





Now that we have a few users created, let's grant them privileges.
Let's start with mary, grant her full administrator access by making use of the 
policy called AdministratorAccess.


Make use of the subcommand attach-user-policy.
The ARN of the AdministratorAccess policy is arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess.
>aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam attach-user-policy --user-name mary --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:poli
cy/AdministratorAccess


Use the subcommand create-group to create the group.
>aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam create-group --group-name project-sapphire-developers


Add the IAM users called jack and jill, who are developers to the new IAM 
Group called project-sapphire-developers.

Use the subcommand add-user-to-group to add users into the group.
>aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam add-user-to-group --user-name jack --group-name project-sapphire-developers

Attach the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy with the ARN: 
arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess to the group project-sapphire-developers.
>aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam attach-group-policy --group-name project-
sapphire-developers  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess
