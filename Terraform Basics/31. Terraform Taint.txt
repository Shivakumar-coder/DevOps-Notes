Tainted: When a resource creation filed, Terraform will mark that resource as tainted an will try to create the 
         resource once again in next plan and apply command.

Use case: There would be a sceen were we are required to recreate a resource, but the Terraform will not 
          do it as it assumes that the resource dosn't need recreating. 
          In this scenario we can mark the resource as tainted with taint command.
    Ex:
    >terraform taint aws_instance.webserver

    To de-mark taint we can use this command
    >terraform untaint aws_instance.webserver
