Infrastructure as Code(IaC): To deploy a resources by running a script or a code is called IaC

Types of IaC Tools:
1. Configuration Management: To install and manage s/w on existing infra. The config management tools 
                             help in maintaining a consistent and a standard structure of code. Whith this 
                             it's easier to manage and update it as needed.
    a. Ansible.
    b. Puppet.
    c. SaltStack.
    d. Chef

2. Server Templating: Say you have done a update of a config for a s/w with config management tool. Now you 
                      need to deploy that changed config, this is were server templating comes into picture.
                      This will updated the config and create a new image with which it's easy to deploy the 
                      update on a large scale ASAP with easy.

3. Infrastructure Provisioning Tools: These tools are used to provision infra components using a simple 
                                      declarative code. These infra components can range from servers such 
                                      as VMs, DBs, VPCs, subnets, SGs, storage and just about any services based
                                      on the provider we choose.
