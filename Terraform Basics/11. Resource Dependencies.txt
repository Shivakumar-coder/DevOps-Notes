Example:
---
resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename=var.filename
    content="My favorite pet is ${random_pet.my-pet.id}"
}

resource "random_pet" "my-pet" {
    prefix=var.prefix
    separator=var.separator
    length=var.length
}

Here local_file resource is dependent on random_pet resource output.
So 1st random_pet resource is created and then local_file resource.
While deleting resource, it's in reverse order. 1st local_file and then random_pet resource.
This type of dependency is called implicit dependency.
Here, we're not explicitly specifying which resource is dependent on which other resource.

We can mention our own dependency by using depends_on argument, this type of dependency is called
explicit dependency.
---
resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename=var.filename
    content="My favorite pet is Mr.Cat"
    depends_on=[
        random_pet.my-pet
    ]
}

resource "random_pet" "my-pet" {
    prefix=var.prefix
    separator=var.separator
    length=var.length
}

Resource A relies on another Resource B but doesn't access any of its attributes in its own arguments. 
What is this type of dependency called?
explicit dependency

How do we make use of implicit dependency?
reference expression
