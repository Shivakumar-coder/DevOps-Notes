Using git to store and retrive state files is not a recommended practice as it contains sensitive info.

When a operation or execution is being performed with terraform, then terraform will not allow or will not 
execute any other execution ||ly. This will ensure that the terraform state file is not corrupted. This is called
state locking were in no 2 operations will be executed ||ly.

This feature of state locking is not supported by version control systems like git. So, it's not a good practice to 
use any such version control system to host your IaC code base.

To mitigate this kind of issues, it's a much better option to store terraform in a shared storage by making use of 
Remote Backend. With this option, the state file no longer resides in the configuration directory.
