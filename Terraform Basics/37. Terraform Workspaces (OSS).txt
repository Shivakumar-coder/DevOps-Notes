>terraform workspace new ProjectA

This will create a new terraform workspace called ProjectA and a default workspace

To switch to that particular workspace
>terraform workspace select ProjectA

When we use terraform workspace, terraform create a new dir under which each terraform dir 
will be created to match the workspace and stores a state file for that workspace.

module "payroll_app" {
  source = "/root/terraform-projects/modules/payroll-app"
  app_region = lookup(var.region, terraform.workspace)
  ami = lookup(var.ami, terraform.workspace)
}
