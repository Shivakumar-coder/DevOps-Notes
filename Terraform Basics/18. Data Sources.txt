Terraform uses both state file along with configuration files to provision infra resources.

Even though if a resource is created manually without using terraform, terraform can read attributes 
of that manually created resource eve if it does not manages that resources.

Datasources give terraform the abality to read from resources which are provisioned outside it's control.

The data resource block helps us to read the resource of that particular resource type.
---
data "local_file" "dog" {
    filename = "/root/dog.txt"
}

To us this info is same as how we use attributes from different block.

Data Sources:
1. Keyword- Data.
2. Can only read infra.
3. Also called Data Resources.

Change is the end result of 
all true learning.
