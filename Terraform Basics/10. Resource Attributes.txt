Resource attribute helps us to link two resources.
Example:
---
resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename=var.filename
    content="My favorite pet is ${random_pet.my-pet.id}"
}

resource "random_pet" "my-pet" {
    prefix=var.prefix
    separator=var.separator
    length=var.length
}

Here ${random_pet.my-pet.id} is written with resource type followed by resource name followed by attribute reference.
The attribute is a combined with "." and forms a run time variable known as interpolation sequence.


Resource "time_static" does not need any arguments to be supplied to work.

When applied as it is, terraform creates a logical resource locally (similar to random_pet) with the current time.
