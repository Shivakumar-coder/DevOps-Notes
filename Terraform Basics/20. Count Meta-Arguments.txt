Count Meta-Argument: One of the easiest way to create multiple instance of the same resource is 
                     to use count argument with value greater than 1.
                     This will create an array of same resource type with index value starting at 0.
            Example: 
            ---
            variable "filename" {
                default = [
                    "/root/pets.txt"
                ]
            }
            ---
            resource "local_file" "pet" {
                filename = var.filename
                count = 3
            }
            After terraform apply cmmd, the resource created will be pet[0], pet[1] and pet[2].
            But the name of the file will not be changed i.e all the files will have name pets.

            To over come this, use count.index attribute.
            ---
            variable "filename" {
                default = [
                    "/root/pets.txt",
                    "/root/dogs.txt",
                    "/root/cats.txt"
                ]
            }
            ---
            resource "local_file" "pet" {
                filename = var.filename[count.index]
                count = 3
            }

            If there is any change in the variable config file, then terraform will recreate each and every 
            resource.
