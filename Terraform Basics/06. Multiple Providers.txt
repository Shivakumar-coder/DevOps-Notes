TF support the use of multiple providers within the same config.

Ex:
---
resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename="/root/pets.txt"
    content="We love pets!"
}

resource "random_pet" "my-pet" {
    prefix="Mrs"
    separator="."
    length="1"
}

In the above example the keyword before "_" is the provider. The keyword following "_" is the resource 
type which is pet.
