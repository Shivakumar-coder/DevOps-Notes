For-Each: To overcome the limitations of Count meta-argument, we can opt for for-each argument.
          the for_each argument will only work with map or set values. Or if we don't want to change 
          the data type in the variable config file, the use toset argument to convert the data type in 
          main config file.
    Example:
    ---
    variable "filename" {
        type=list(string)
        default = [
            "/root/pets.txt",
            "/root/dogs.txt",
            "/root/cats.txt"
        ]
    }
    ---
    resource "local_file" "pet" {
        filename = each.value
        for_each = toset(var.filename)
    }
                       Or
    ---
    variable "filename" {
        type=set(string)
        default = [
            "/root/pets.txt",
            "/root/dogs.txt",
            "/root/cats.txt"
        ]
    }
    ---
    resource "local_file" "pet" {
        filename = each.value
        for_each = var.filename
    }

By useing set or map data type, the terraform will identify each resource with their identifiers instead of 
allocating each resources with an index id, thereby bypassing indexing.
