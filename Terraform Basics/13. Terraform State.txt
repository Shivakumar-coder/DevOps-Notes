Terraform workflow

1. We run terraform init cmmd to download necessary plugins.

2. We create the execution plan by terraform plan cmmd
    The 1st line in the output will show us that terraform tries to refresh the 
    state in-memory prior to the plan. If it's 1st time, then there is no details 
    related to state printed, which implies there is no state recorded at this moment in time.
    By this terraform understands that there is no resources provisioned based on config file and 
    then creates execution plan of create.

3. We run terraform apply cmmd.
    This cmmd will also tries to refresh the in-memory state, finds that there is no state recorded 
    at the moment, and then proceeds to create an execution plan. Terraform creates the local file resources 
    as expected. Terraform creates a unique ID for the resource as seen in the cmmd output.


After running the terraform apply, we can see an additional file called terraform.tfstate in the same dir, 
this file is called terraform state file, which was created as a result of the terraform apply cmmd.
The state file is the json data structure that maps the real-world infra resource to the resources in the 
config files.
If we edit the config file and run apply again, the terraform by default refreshes the state again and compares it 
again to the config file. It now knows that the config file is edited and has a different value in the config file 
as compared to the terraform state and the real world.
