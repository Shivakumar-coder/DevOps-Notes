Terraform by default will download and install latest plugin.
We can change this behaviour by using required_providers block inside terraform.
Ex:
---
terraform {
    required_providers {
        local = {
            source = "hashicorp/local"
            version = "1.4.0" ---------------> "!= 2.0.0" this will ensure any other version is download except 2.0.0
        }
    }
}

resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = "/root/pet.txt"
    content = "We love pets!"
}


version = "> 1.2.0, < 2.0.0, != 1.4.0"

version = "~> 1.2" -------> This means if there is any version greater than 1.2 till 1.9, download that else go with 1.2
This is called pessimistic constraint operator.
