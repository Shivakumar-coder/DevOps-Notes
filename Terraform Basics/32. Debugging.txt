When things go wrong in terraform, the 1st thing to look is for logs to find the cause.
Terraform will in general display consol logs and error which is causing issues.
In case we need to look deeper, we need to make use of environment variable called TF_LOG and set to one of the log levels.
1. INFO
2. WARNING
3. ERROR
4. DEBUG
5. TRACE - TRACE being the most verbose logging of then all.

>export TF_LOG=ERROR

When we run terraform cmmds after setting the env variables we should see a lot of additional logs based on 
the level that has been set.

To store logs in a file, use env variable called TF_LOG_PATH
>export TF_LOG_PATH=/tmp/terraform.log

To disable logging, unset env variable
>unset TF_LOG_PATH
