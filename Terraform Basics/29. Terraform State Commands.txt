Terraform state file should not be edited with any editor or make any type of changes manualy.
Instead we should make use of Terraform state command.

Syntax:
terraform state <subcommand> [options] [args]

List: This will list all the resources recorded within the Terraform state file.
terraform state list [options] [address]

terraform state list show command: This command will show the attributes of a single resource in the 
        state file that matches the given address.
    Ex: >terraform state show aws_s3 


Move command: This command is used to move items in a Terraform state file. The items can be moved within the 
              same state file, which would mean moving a resource from it's current resource address to another, 
              which essentially means renaming a resource or it can move items from one state file to another 
              state file maintained by a different config dir completely.
    Syntax: terraform state mv [options] SOURCE DESTINATION
    Ex:
    >terraform state mv aws_dynamodb_table.state-locking aws_dynamodb_table.state-locking-db
    This will change the name of the resource in the state file but not in config file which we wrote.
    We need to manualy change the name in the config file.


Terraform state pull: This command helps us to download and display the remote state on the screen
    Syntax: terraform state pull

State remove: It is used to delete items from the Terraform state file. This command is used when you no longer wish 
              to manage one or more resources via the current Terraform configuration and state. The resource removed 
              are not actually destroyed from the real world infra.
    Syntax: terraform state rm [resource-address]
