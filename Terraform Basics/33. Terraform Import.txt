How to bring existing infra to Terraform config using Terraform import command ?

By making use of terraform import command we can bring the existing resources under terraform management.
Syntax:
>terraform import <resource_type>.<resource_name> <attribute>
Ex:
>terraform import aws_instance.webserver-2 i-uoi4tb2yb2yp

When we execute this command we will see error msg.
This is because Terraform import does not update the config file at all.
It will only update the state file with the details of the infra being imported.

To overcome this error, create an empty resource lock with the same resource type and run the import cmmd again.
Now the cmmd will run without any errors.
After this we need to manualy fill in that resource block with the details we need.
