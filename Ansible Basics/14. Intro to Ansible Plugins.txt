Ansible Plugin: A piece of code that modifies the functionality of Ansible.
                Enhances various aspects of Ansible like Inventory, Modules and Callbacks.
                Plugins provide flexible and powerful way to customize.
                Ansible Plugin ca be in the form of Inventory Plugin, Module Plugin, Action Plugin 
                or Callback Plugin.

Dynamic Inventory Plugin: This plugin will fetch real-time info about your cloud resources directly from your 
                          cloud provider's API. This dynamic inventory plugin enables you to have an up-to-date 
                          view of your infrastructure, ensuring accurate and reliable automation.

Module Plugin: When you develop a custom module plugin, you gain the power to provision cloud resources with
               custom configurations. This plugin integrates seamlessly with your cloud provider's API, allowing 
               you to create instances with specific AMI versions, instance types and security groups tailored to 
               your application's requirements. Module Plugin allows you to integrate with a cloud provider's API 
               for custom resource provisioning.

Action Plugin: This plugin simplifies load balancer management. With an action plugin, you can define high-level 
               tasks in your playbooks, making it easy to configure load balancing rules, SSL certificates, 
               and Health checks. The action plugin handeles the underlying API calls and ensures consistent and 
               reliable load balancer management across your hybrid cloud environment.

Apart from the above plugins, Ansible offers othert plugins that can further extend it's functionality.

Lookup plugins; are handy tools that fetch data from external sources like databases or APIs and let you use that 
data within your playbooks.

Filter plugin; offer additional data manipulation and transformation capabilities within your playbooks allowing you 
to modify variables or format output.

Connection plugin; enable Ansible to connect and communicate with various target systems such as SSH, WinRM or Docker.

Dynamic Inventory; plugins allow Ansible to retrieve inventory info from various sources like cloud providers or config 
management database.

Callback plugins; provide hooks into Ansible's execution lifecycle allowing you to capture events and perform custom 
actions during playbook execution
