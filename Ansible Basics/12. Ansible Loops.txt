Loops: Loop is a looping directive that executes the same task multiple number of times.
       Each time it runs, it stores the value of each item in the loop in a variable named called item

Example:
---
-
 name: Create users
 hosts: localhost
 tasks:
  - user: name='{{ item }}' state=present
    loop:
      - joe
      - george
      - ravi
      - mani
      - kiran
      - jazlan
      - emaan

We are attempting to install multiple packages using the yum module for a more realistic use case. 
The playbook /home/bob/playbooks/packages.yml installs only a single package. 
Update it to install all packages defined under packages variable.

---
- name: 'Install required packages'
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  vars:
    packages:
      - httpd
      - make
      - vim
  tasks:
    - yum:
        name: '{{ item }}'
        state: present
      with_items: '{{ packages }}'

The with_* is a legacy looping mechanism, now improvised to use with other directives as well 
like
  with_items:
    - <1st item variable>
    - <2nd item variable>
    - <3rd item variable>
    - <4th item variable>

  with_files:
    - "<1st file path>"
    - "<2nd file path>"
  
  with_url:
    - "<1st url>"
    - "<2nd url>"
    - "<3rd url>"
  
  with_mongodb:
    - database: dev
      connection_string: "mongodb://dev.mongo/"
    - database: prod
      connection_string: "mongodb://prod.mongo/"
  
  with_dict
  with_etcd
  with_env
  with_filetree
  with_ini
  with_inventory_hostnames
  with_k8s
