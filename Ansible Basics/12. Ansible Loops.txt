Loops: Loop is a looping directive that executes the same task multiple number of times.
       Each time it runs, it stores the value of each item in the loop in a variable named called item

Example:
---
-
 name: Create users
 hosts: localhost
 tasks:
  - user: name='{{ item }}' state=present
    loop:
      - joe
      - george
      - ravi
      - mani
      - kiran
      - jazlan
      - emaan

We are attempting to install multiple packages using the yum module for a more realistic use case. 
The playbook /home/bob/playbooks/packages.yml installs only a single package. 
Update it to install all packages defined under packages variable.

---
- name: 'Install required packages'
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  vars:
    packages:
      - httpd
      - make
      - vim
  tasks:
    - yum:
        name: '{{ item }}'
        state: present
      with_items: '{{ packages }}'
