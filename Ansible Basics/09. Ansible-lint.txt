As the playbook starts to expand and the complexity increases, they become more difficult to understand and maintain.
As we movefurther we need a mechanism to ensure consistency and quality across all our playbook.

Ansible Lint: This is a command line tool that performs linting on Ansible playbooks, roles and collections.
              It checks your code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs.
              It's akin to having a seasoned Ansible mentor guiding you, providing valuable insights and catching
              issues that might have slipped past your notice.

Command:
>ansible-lint <ansible-playbook-name>.yml
