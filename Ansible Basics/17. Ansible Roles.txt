Ansible roles: The primary purpose of roles is to make your work reusable.
               Be it for other tasks or projects within your organization or outside for others globally.
               Roles also help in organizing your code within Ansible.
               Roles introduce a set of best practices that must be followed to organize all tasks 
               into a task directory, all variables used by these tasks in the vars directory, any 
               default values goes into the defaults directory, any templates used by the playbooks go into the 
               templates directory.

Example:
---
-
  name: Install and Configure MySQL

        mysql_user_name: db-user
