Ansible roles: The primary purpose of roles is to make your work reusable.
               Be it for other tasks or projects within your organization or outside for others globally.
               Roles also help in organizing your code within Ansible.
               Roles introduce a set of best practices that must be followed to organize all tasks 
               into a task directory, all variables used by these tasks in the vars directory, any 
               default values goes into the defaults directory, any templates used by the playbooks go into the 
               templates directory.

What ever the roll you think off is already been written and shared in Ansible Galaxy.

How does the ansible knows were the role playbook is stored.
When we first download the roles dir from community, it will be stored in /etc/ansible/roles
To make use of the downloaded roles, we need to move the roles directory under the directive in which you want 
you to use the roles.

Example:
---
-
  name: Install and Configure MySQL
  hosta: db-server
  roles:
    - greenlineguy.mysql
    - nginx
      become: yes
      vars:
        mysql_user_name: db-user


To view list of roles
>ansible-galaxy list

To view the location were roles would be installed.
>ansible-config dump | grep ROLE

To install roles under current directive
>ansible-galaxy install greenlineguy.mysql -p ./roles
