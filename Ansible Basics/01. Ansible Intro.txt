When we install Ansible on a machine. It will create a default config file at /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg 
This config file will govern the default behaviour of ansible using a set of parameters.

The default config file can be over written and can be used from a different folder as well.
$ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/opt/ansible-web.cfg ansible-playbook playbook.yml

The 1st priority is given to the parameters configured in the file specified through an env variable.
2nd priority is given to ansible.cfg file which is present in current dir from which ansible is run.
3rd priority is given to .ansible.cfg file present in the users home dir.
Last priority is given to default config dir /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

All ansible playbooks are written in YAML type file.


Sample commands to view configurations:
1. List all configurations
>ansible-config list

2. Show the current config file
>ansible-config view

3. Show the current settings
>ansible-config dump
