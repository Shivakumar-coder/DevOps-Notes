Ansible Handlers: With handlers you can define an action to restart the web server service and associate it 
                  with the task that modifies the configuration file. This creates a dependency between the 
                  task and the handler. Now when ever the configuration file is modified during the playbook run,
                  the associated handler is triggered ensuring that the web server service is automatically restarted.
                  By utilizing handlers, you eliminate the need for manual intervention and ensure that the web server
                  service is always restarted when necessary.

                  Handlers are specific tasks associated with specific events or notifications.
                  They're typically defined in a playbook and are executed only when triggered by a task notifying them.
                  Handlers enable you to manage actions that depend on the state or config changes of your systems.
