Ansible can work with 1 or more system at the same time. In order to work with multiple 
systems, ansible needs to establish connection with those system.

Connectivity between linux system is usually done by SSH, for windows Connectivity can be done by Powershell Remoting.

Ansible offers Agentless connection meaning that it only requires only SSH connection so that master system with Ansible 
installed only needs ssh connection to connect to target system without needing to install any agents on the target system.

The information will be stored in an inventory file. If the inventory if is not specified, then ansible will pickup default 
file stored at /etc/ansible/hosts directory.

Inventory file contains below statements.

server1.company.com
server2.company.com

[mail]--------->to define group name we use square brackets with a group name written in it.
server3.company.com -------------------> The system written under that group name belongs to that group.
server4.company.com

[db]------------------>group name
server5.company.com--->system belongs to that group name
server6.company.com

[web]
server7.company.com
server8.company.com

=======================================Parameters=======================================

"ansible_host" parameter : This parameter will allow users to assign a system or FQDN or IP address to a name.

Ex:
web ansible_host=server1.company.com
db ansible_host=server2.company.com

Other parameters are:
1. ansible_connection : used to specify the type of connection to be done like ssh/winrm/localhost
                        If we do not wish to connect to any other systems, then we can connect to localhost.


2. ansible_port : This will allow us to specify which port of the system should ansible connect with.
                  Default being port 22 for ssh.


3. ansible_user : This will allow to specify which type of user connection to be made. Is it a root or administrator or etc.
                  Default being root for linux machines.


4. ansible_ssh_pass : With this parameter users can specify password used for connection.
                      For Linux based hosts, use ansible_ssh_pass parameter 
                      and for Windows based hosts, use ansible_password parameter.

Ex:
web ansible_host=server1.company.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root

db ansible_host=server2.company.com ansible_connection=winrm ansible_user=admin

mail ansible_host=server3.company.com ansible_connection=ssh ansible_ssh_pass=ireg3489p

web2 ansible_host=server4.company.com ansible_connection=winrm

localhost ansible_connection=localhost
=================================================================================================================
There are two formats to write inventory files:
1. INI format: Useed when the organisation is small or not complex. Example below

[webservers]
server1.company.com
server2.company.com

[dbservers]
server3.company.com
server4.company.com

2. YAML format: Used in large organisation and is complex. Example below

all:
    children:
        webservers:
            hosts:
                web1.example.com:
                web2.example.com:
        dbservers:
            hosts:
                db1.example.com:
                db2.example.com:
=================================================================================================================

Grouping and Parent-Child Relationships:
all:
    children:
        webservers:
            children:
                webservers_us:
                    hosts:
                        server1_us.com:
                            ansible_host: <IPv4 address>
                        server2_us.com:
                            ansible_host: <IPv4 address>
                webservers_eu:
                    hosts:
                        server1_eu.com:
                            ansible_host: <IPv4 address>
                        server2_eu.com:
                            ansible_host: <IPv4 address>
