Registering Variables and Variable Precedence


The variable defined at host level will be the 1st priority than the same variabel defined at group level.
Priority Order:

1. Extra Variable: This refers to the variabel set at command line. This has the highest priority.

2. Play Variable: This refers to the variabel set in a playbook. This has the 2nd most priority.

3. Host Variable: This refers to the variable set at the time of deleraing a host. This has 3rd priority.

4. Group Variable: This refers to the variabel set at group declaration level. This has last priority.


These are the 4 important levels at which variables are set. There are totle of 22 types of variable.

Register Variable: This type of variable will help us store the output of other command and used to send as an 
                    input to other variables.
                    These variables will fall under host scope.
Example:
---
- name: Check /etc/hosts file
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - shell: cat /etc/hosts
    register: result

  - debug:
      var: result.rc or result.stdout

Pass variabel file as input in command like this
>$ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml -v
