If u r in old shell and want to run the bash script it won't give expected output.
add a line in the very begining of the every script u write.
#!/bin/bash
This will tell that it's a bash script
Similarly
If u want the shell to know it's a shell script
#!/bin/sh

Bourne Shell - sh
Debian Almquist shell - dash
Bourne again Shell - bash
