To pass value to variables inside the script file. The values written after the shell script command is stored 
in a built in variable name. The cmmd itself is stored in a variable $0 and the argument passed with the cmmd 
at $1 and so on.
Syntax


Ex:
$ create-and-launch-rocket lunar-mission

create-and-launch-rocket -----------> $0 argument in command line
lunar-mission ----------------------> $1 argument in command line
.                                     .
.                                     .
.                                     .
.                                     .
.                                     .
.                                     $<n-1> argument in command line


create-and-launch-rocket.sh
mission_name=$1
.
.
.

Now shell script will look like this


Best Practice:
1. Design your script to be re-usable.
2. Script should not require to be edited before running.
3. Use command line argument to pass inputs.
