Syntax:
function <function_name>() {
    <commands>
}
-----------------------------
Ex:
function launch-rocket() {
    mission_name=$1
    .
    .
    .
}

launch-rocket lunar-mission

In the above example the function launch-rocket is all with argument lunar-mission, 
that lunar-mission is accepted by the function as command line argument

A function will return 1 if successful. If a exit cmd is used in place of return, 
then the script stops execution.

The return statement will only return a number but not a string.
The return will mainly be used to return exit status.

The function block should always be written at the start of each file and before that function is called.

Ex:
function add()
{ 
  sum=$(( $1 + $2 ))
  echo $sum
}

result=$(add 3 5)
echo "The result is $result"

Answer: The function must echo the result so that it can be captured in the result variable.
