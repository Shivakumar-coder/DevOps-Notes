In Dockerfile:

For the use of command
    Example-
        FROM Ubuntu
                      |----Paramater 
        CMD ["sleep","5"]
                ^---------command
                or
        CMD sleep 5 (this way of setting CMD is not appreciated)

    Running this container:
    docker run Ubuntu-sleeper

For the use of entrypoint: When the image starts, from that point of time we need that container to run a cmmd automatically
without any manual intervention. For this use case, we have ENTRYPOINT.
    Example-
        FROM Ubuntu
        ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
    
    Running this container:
    docker run Ubuntu-sleeper 10
    docker run Ubuntu-sleeper --------------> running this command will result in error as there is no paramater for sleep
    ^^to over come this use both CMD and ENTRYPOINT

For the use of both CMD and ENTRYPOINT:
    Example-
        FROM Ubuntu

        ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]

        CMD ["5"]

To override the entrypoint cmmd, user below docker command
>docker run --entrypoint <command> <image_name> <paramater>
