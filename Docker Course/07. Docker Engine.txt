Docker Engine has 3 components:

    1. Docker Deamon : This is a background processes that manages docker objects like images, containers, n/w and volumes.
        /\
        ||
        \/
    2. REST API : The docker rest API server is the API interface that programs can use to talk to the daemon and instructions
        /\
        ||
        \/
    3. Docker CLI : This is what we use to perform actions like run, stop, build containers.

1 and 2 can be on different host, separetly from 3

To use 1 and 2 from different 3:
    >docker -H=<remot-docker-engine-url / IP >:<port>
Example:
    docker -H=10.123.2.1:3255 run nginx

How does Docker actually work under the hood ?

Docker uses namespace to isolate workspaces, process IDs, n/w, interprocess communications, mounts and Unix timesharing
systems are created in their own namespace. Thereby providing isolation between containers.

Docker containers can able to utilise all the available CPU and memory, to restrict this Docker uses cgroups or 
control groups to restrict the amount of hardware resources allocated to each container.

This can be done by providing the --cpus option to the Docker run command.
>docker run --cpus=.5 ubuntu --------> This will ensure containers will not use more than 50% of the CPU
>docker run --memory=100m ubuntu ----> For memory
