>docker run nginx

Here to better understand the image name nginx

1. This image follows Docker's image naming convention, nginx here is the image or the repository name.

2. Since we didn't mention the path from which account it should be pulled, it defaults to library 
   account in cloud registry.

3. Since we have not specified the location from were these images are stored and pulled from, it defaults to Docker's 
   own public available registry called Docker Hub with DNS name as docker.io

So the command will be expanded as
>docker run docker.io/library/nginx

How to save the work done in a container as an image:
    >docker commit <container_name/container_id> <docker_hub_user_name>/<docker_image_name>
    Ex: sudo docker commit <container_id> shivakumar1coder/apache
    Here image_name can be your choise

How to push image to docker hub:
1. Login in your machine: >docker login
      This will ask for docker hub creds.

2. Now push the image: >docker push shivakumar1coder/apache

All big tech have there own registry

If we want to have our own in house registry, then we can pull a image from Docker Hub called registry and set it up to 
our needs
>docker run --name my-registry -d -p 5000:5000 registry:2 .

Now how to push an image to our in-house registry
>docker image tag <image-name> <url-of-the-registry>:<port>/<image_name>

1. First tag the image
>docker image tag my-image localhost:5000/my-image

2. Now Push the image to in-house registry
>docker push localhost:5000/my-image


To pull only a image from Docker:
>docker image pull <image_name>
