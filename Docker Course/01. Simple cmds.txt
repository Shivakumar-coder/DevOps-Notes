Know the docker software installed version:
    >docker --version

Start a container:
    >docker run <container_image_name>

List container:
    >docker ps (List all running containers)
    >docker ps -a (List all containers which are present)

Stop a container:
    >docker stop <container_name>

Remove a container
    >docker rm <container_name> (will stop a container if running and delete it)
    >docker rm -f <container_name>(will force stop and remove)
    >docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)(docker will remove all the present container in the machine)

List Images
    >docker images(will list all images with it's size)

Remove images
    >docker rmi <image_name>(all running containers off this image should be stopped or deleted)

Download an image
    >docker pull <image_name>(will only pull the image and will not run any container of it)

Start a container with name in detach mode:
    >docker run -d --name <given_name> <image_name>

Command to find the base OS of a image:
    >docker run <image_name> cat /etc/*release*

Command to run container with name:
    >docker run --name <name> <image_name>

Execute a command on a running container
    >docker exec <container_name> <command_to_be_executed>
        This will run a command and takes the STDIN access from user and ends the terminal connection

Execute a command on a running container and stay in the terminal
    >docker exec -it <container_name> <command_to_be_executed>
